It's a modern skin for Linux `Alpine Configuration Framework` commonly called [ACF](https://wiki.alpinelinux.org/wiki/Alpine_Configuration_Framework_Design)

[Alpine](https://alpinelinux.org/about/) Linux became popular since `Docker` image size and efficiency are essestial.  
Minimalist & Secure Linux Distro, `Alpine` is perfect for low powered and/or low performances systems. 

**The perfect solution for reduce waste of system ressources and downsizing energy consumption.  
Even in a large scale architecture**  

Alpine is quite secure :

> *"Alpine Linux was designed with security in mind. All userland binaries are compiled as Position Independent Executables (PIE) with stack smashing protection. These proactive security features prevent exploitation of entire classes of zero-day and other vulnerabilities."  
<sub>[Alpine Linux - Website](https://alpinelinux.org/about/)</sub>*

<h2>Setup</h2>

<ins>**Requirement**</ins> **:**

From any fresh install on : `system` `container` `image` or `VM` !

  ```css
  $: setup-alpine
  ``` 
  
It's an Alpine native & build-in `script` to setup entire system, this include :

- Keyboard Keys LANG
- User
- Password
- <ins>**Networking**</ins>
- Hostname

**!** <ins>**Important**</ins> **: We need networking for acces to ACF from local network**

<h2>Install</h2>

`Alpine Configuration Framework` - [ACF](https://wiki.alpinelinux.org/wiki/Alpine_Configuration_Framework_Design) had it's own MVC app design from CGI Scripts

- **HTML Files** are include in `Lua` language (small & fast framework mostly design for embedded device)
- **Framework Files** are include in skin folder (so be carreful of security permission and code remaining) skin files override core template 
- **Views** are served by `mini_httpd` server (fast and secure way to split `local` network server and `nginx public` reverse proxy) so completly separate all this two configs
- **CSS Files** are store in easy way to `css` folder

All files and folders are store on local system in ` /usr/share/acf/www/skins/trinity `

<ins>**Get ACF First**</ins> :
  
  ```css
  $: setup-acf
  ```
  
 Edit [ACF](https://wiki.alpinelinux.org/wiki/Alpine_Configuration_Framework_Design#ACF_Layout) core config file `/etc/acf/acf.conf` and replace following lines for overriding core template
 
  ```css
 ...
 # Directories where the application resides
 ...
appdir=/usr/share/acf/www/skins/trinity/app/,/usr/share/acf/app/
libdir=/usr/share/acf/www/skins/trinity/lib/,/usr/share/acf/lib/
wwwdir=/usr/share/acf/www/
staticdir=/skins/static/
skindir=/skins/,/userskins/
...
