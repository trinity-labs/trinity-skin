# This gives basic priorities to the groups in the menu
# That way, individual menu files don't have to say "80Setup" everywhere
# Note, however, that if ANY individual menu sets Setup to less than 80, then
# That number will override the defaults set here.
# (i.e. Lowest specifically set priority wins)
